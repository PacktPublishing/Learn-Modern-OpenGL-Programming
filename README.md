# Learn Modern OpenGL Programming
This is the code repository for [Learn Modern OpenGL Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-deep-learning-tensorflow-20-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789951707), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This course will introduce you to modern OpenGL programming. We’ll teach you a brief history of OpenGL to help you understand why we chose to teach modern OpenGL with its programmable rendering pipeline over the fixed function pipeline.
We’ll begin with the basics of getting OpenGL running in a window using the GLFW library. Then we move on to the basics of rendering polygons to the display by sending buffers of data to the computers graphics card and programming it using shaders with the GLSL shading language. Then you’ll learn how to map textures to your objects. You'll also set up a virtual camera using keyboard and mouse inputs to enable you to move around in the scene.
After you have the fundamentals working, you can start building more complex things. You’ll learn how to load 3D models and add interesting lighting to the scene. By the end of this course, you’ll know how to set up and render in 3D with modern OpenGL. With each lesson, we’ll build the framework with reusable C++ and OpenGL code. This is a great starting place for you to build your own game engine. 
We’ll start with a blank project and write code each step of the way. Each lesson builds on the last. Even if you’ve never touched OpenGL, you should find the course easy to follow and everything is explained along the way. All of the source code, pre-built third-party libraries, and Visual Studio solutions for each lesson are included.
